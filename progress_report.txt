============
- Created branch sigmaboi123
- Created fungsi.c, library.h and main.c
- fungsi.c:
	- created code prototype for baca_data_dokter, simpan_kalendar_csv, and simpan_kalendar_dokter_csv in C
- library.h:
	- defined struct Dokter, enum Shift
	- defined input and output for baca_data_dokter, generate_jadwal, simpan_kalendar_csv, and simpan_kalendar_dokter_csv function
	- gave a brief explanation of the expected input, output and the way the function works for baca_data_dokter, generate_jadwal, simpan_kalendar_csv, and simpan_kalendar_dokter_csv function
- main.c:
	- created a code prototype that calls for functions from fungsi.c to be executed.

20 June 2025
============
- Updated fungsi.c, main.c, and library.h
- fungsi.c:

	- fixed code prototype for simpan_kalendar_csv to print multiple doctor on one shift
- main.c:
	- fixed access location of library.h to src/library.h
- library.h:
	- updated documentation of how the code works since there was a few tweaks added
